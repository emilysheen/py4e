Job hunting is like dating
You think you're cool and talented
But there's a hundred other cooler and more talented looking profiles.
You think you're smart and qualified
But there's PhD's and decades-experienced competitors out there, fishing for cash cows.

I think my brains will get munched up by the hungry sharks
But they've found bigger ones in dead whale skulls that taste yummier and smarter.
I hope someone eats my brains soon
Or I might become a zombie eating everyone else's brains.
